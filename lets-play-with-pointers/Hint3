# Spoiler alert !
I'll give some implementation helps here !!!!!

Some of you I'm sure must have think of an algorithm of the form :
well, if I store all of the nodes in an array, then I just have to insert them one by one, wwwweelllll, it's not bad but very tricky to do !
If you want to stic to your idea, you can continure reading this help, else juste go to the next Hint !

The main way to store bunk data is on the stack. You might have think of a recursive function which add them on the stack one by one.
That could be a good idea if you didn't have to store extrat information for each call. This extrat information can't be store in registers (because
they would be modified in the next call) neither on the stack because you don't want to messup with the data you're trying to store !

The solution is to "allocate" some place on the stack. But the stricky part is, you HAVE to know the number of elements you want to put in the stack,
so you have to count the number of nodes in the tree before doing anything. Then you should be able to create an algorithm preaty easily by playing with the
%rsp register and %rbp register (just always remember to reset them to their old value when youre done !)
