# Here are some complements on pointers so you may be less lost
## Pointer arithmetic
When dealing with pointers, you some time operates directly on the adress like :

	movb	5(%rdi), %rax

But you always have to be carefull. Suppose you've got data of 8 bytes each (this is not a random value, this the size of the data in the structure of tree).
Well if you want to access to the 2nd value, then you have to move the pointer of 8 byte, not juste one :

	movq	8(%rdi), %rax

And 16 bytes if you want to access the third element and so on. Just as a remarque, notice the fact the I changed the suffix.
Always make sure you're using the right suffix, this can help you when debbuging !
