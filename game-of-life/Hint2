When you want to update a sell, you might want to use the old value later.
To do it without using a brand new table, you can store the next state in the second byte.
For example, if your cell is alive (0b00000001), then if it stills alive in the next stage, you can update this value in 0b00000011.
So when you've updated all the values in the table, you can juste parse it and shift each elements to the right.
